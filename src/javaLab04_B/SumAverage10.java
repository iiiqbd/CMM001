[SumAverage10.java]
Implement a Java program that uses a while loop to prompts the user to enter at least one,
and up to 10, positive double values. But the user may signal that they are finished entering
numbers by entering a sentinel value less than 0.0.
After the loop is finished, the program should display the sum and average of all values
entered (excluding any sentinel value).
