/*
[NumbersToWords.java]
Write a Java program that will prompt the user to enter an integer in the range 20 to 99.
The program should display the text equivalent of the integer e.g.
· if the user enters 21 then the program should output "twenty one"
· if the user enters 47 then the program should output "forty seven"
Hint: separate the tens from the units e.g. tens = number/10, and units = number%10 and
then use switch statements based on the numbers of tens and units
