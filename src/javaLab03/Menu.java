/*
[Menu.java] Design and implement a java application that
(a)displays an input dialog containing a message
			A chocolate [75p]
			B toffee    [60p]
			C cookie    [90p]
				Please enter your choice of product
(b)takes the user input (a char A, B or C) and, using a switch statement:
			assigns the relevant numerical value to an int itemPrice
			assigns the relevant text to a String itemName
(c)displays an input dialog containing a message
				How many items do you require
and converts the user input and assigns it to an integer number
(d)displays a message dialog summarising the order and giving the total cost
e.g. for an order of 4 cookies display "Your order is for 4 cookies and will cost 360p"

Think about how you could make the program cope with an unexpected user input (i.e.
something other than A, B or C in step (b).
